# Wallarm AWS Terraform Module

[Wallarm](https://www.wallarm.com/) is the platform Dev, Sec, and Ops teams choose to build cloud-native APIs securely, monitor them for modern threats, and get alerted when threats arise. Whether you protect some of the legacy apps or brand new cloud-native APIs, Wallarm provides key components to secure your business against emerging threats.

This repo contains the module for deploying Wallarm on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) using Terraform.

![Wallarm proxy scheme](https://github.com/wallarm/terraform-aws-wallarm/blob/main/images/wallarm-as-proxy.png?raw=true)

By implementing the Wallarm Terraform module, we have provided the solution enabling two core Wallarm deployment options: proxy and mirror security solutions. The deployment option is easily controlled by the `preset` Wallarm module variable. You can try both options by deploying either the [provided examples](https://github.com/wallarm/terraform-aws-wallarm/tree/main/examples) or configuring the module itself.

## Requirements

* Terraform 1.0.5 or higher [installed locally](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
* Access to the account with the **Administrator** role in Wallarm Console in the [EU Cloud](https://my.wallarm.com/) or [US Cloud](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/)
* Access to `https://api.wallarm.com` if working with EU Wallarm Cloud or to `https://us1.api.wallarm.com` if working with US Wallarm Cloud. Please ensure the access is not blocked by a firewall
